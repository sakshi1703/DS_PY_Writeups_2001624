Define your Problem statement and ML technique I(one) you propose to use\n","\n","->  Problem statement: The Gender Gap in Spanish WP dataset contains information on the number of male and female biographies and articles on Wikipedia in Spanish. The dataset provides insights into the extent of gender bias in online platforms such as Wikipedia. The problem statement is to analyze the data and identify the extent of the gender gap in the dataset.\n","\n","ML technique: One machine learning technique that can be used to analyze this dataset is classification. Specifically, we can use a binary classification algorithm to classify biographies and articles as either male or female. The goal would be to identify patterns in the dataset that can be used to predict the gender of a biography or article based on various features such as the length of the article, the number of images, the number of edits, etc. This would provide insights into the factors that contribute to gender bias in Wikipedia and help in designing interventions to address the issue.\n","\n","The steps involved in this ML approach would include data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables, feature engineering to select relevant features for the classification model, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. We could use various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines (SVMs) to build the model. Model evaluation could be done using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n","\n","Overall, the ML technique of classification can help us analyze the Gender Gap in Spanish WP dataset and identify the factors contributing to gender bias in online platforms."],"metadata":{"id":"_rBCqtdm7Tu1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.  Write about working of ML technique I you have proposed \n","\n","->  The ML technique I proposed for analyzing the Gender Gap in Spanish WP dataset is binary classification. This technique involves building a model that can predict the gender of a biography or article based on various features in the dataset.\n","\n","The working of the binary classification algorithm involves several steps:\n","\n","Data preprocessing: This step involves handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Missing values can be replaced with the mean or median value of the feature or dropped altogether. Categorical variables can be one-hot encoded or label encoded depending on the algorithm used.\n","\n","Feature engineering: This step involves selecting relevant features for the classification model. Features can be selected based on their correlation with the target variable or using domain knowledge. In the Gender Gap in Spanish WP dataset, features such as the length of the article, the number of images, and the number of edits can be selected.\n","\n","Model selection: This step involves selecting an appropriate algorithm for the classification task. Common algorithms used for binary classification include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs). The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem statement.\n","\n","Hyperparameter tuning: This step involves fine-tuning the parameters of the selected algorithm to improve the model's performance. Hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter, the learning rate, and the number of estimators can be tuned using techniques such as grid search or random search.\n","\n","Model evaluation: This step involves evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of the model can be further improved by adjusting the threshold for classification or using techniques such as cross-validation.\n","\n","Once the binary classification model is built and evaluated, it can be used to identify the extent of gender bias in the Gender Gap in Spanish WP dataset. The model can provide insights into the factors that contribute to gender bias in online platforms such as Wikipedia and help design interventions to address the issue."],"metadata":{"id":"Z4LkKPgJ71mt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.
